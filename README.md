I started my programming journey in 2009, and since 2020, I have been working professionally on real-world projects. In 2023, I founded **TechLiberty Software Solutions** [website](www.techliberty.co), where I have been developing projects and providing support to companies to help them achieve their digital goals. You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammedozdmr) or visit my [website](http://www.muhammedozdemir.net).

## üìù About Me
I graduated with honors in Mathematics and Computer Science, and during my university years, I also pursued a minor in Molecular Biology and Genetics, which allowed me to broaden my skills across different disciplines. After graduation, I continued to gain experience by working professionally while enhancing my skills through the FullStack Developer program at Wissen Akademie.

My educational journey didn‚Äôt stop there. I completed a Unity game development training at Google Academy, followed by the Google Professional Project Management course, which I completed with distinction. This training helped me gain a solid understanding of Agile and Scrum methodologies.

Throughout both academic programs, I continued to work on various projects, and I have kept my knowledge up-to-date by earning certifications from different platforms. Currently, I‚Äôm working on real-world projects and continuing my learning journey to advance my skills in software development.
